Workday Open Frame
===============

Workday Open Frame is an open-source add-on to Microsoft Internet Explorer that enables modern web technologies to work within older versions of IE browsers (IE 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x).
This add-on enables specific websites to be rendered using the open-source Chromium browser (http://www.chromium.org/Home) which supports modern web technologies. 

At Workday, we are committed to building cloud applications that go beyond the limits of traditional enterprise software. To achieve our goal of providing unparalleled
levels of user experience, we make use of the new capabilities available only in modern browsers. We provide this add-on to support our customers who remain on older versions
of IE browsers so that you may experience all of Workday's features and functionality.
