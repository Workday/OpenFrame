"""Dispatches tests, either sharding or replicating them.

To dispatch, performs the following steps:
* Create a test collection factory, using the given tests
  - If sharding: test collection factory returns the same shared test collection
    to all test runners
  - If replciating: test collection factory returns a unique test collection to
    each test runner, with the same set of tests in each.
* Get the list of devices to run on
* Create test runners
* Run each test runner in its own thread, pulling tests from the test collection
  generated from the test collection factory until there are no tests left.
