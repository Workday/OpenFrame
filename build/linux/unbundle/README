This directory is provided in the source tree to follow above guidelines.
It is a compromise solution which takes into account Chromium developers
who want to avoid the perceived burden of more conditional code in gyp,
and expectations of Open Source community, where using system-provided
libraries is the norm.

Usage:

replace_gyp_files.py <gyp-flags>

For example: replace_gyp_files.py -Duse_system_harfbuzz=1

The script ignores flags other than -D for convenience. This makes it possible
to have a variable e.g. ${myconf} with all the options, and execute:

build/linux/unbundle/replace_gyp_files.py ${myconf}
build/gyp_chromium ${myconf}
