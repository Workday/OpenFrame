This directory contains:
-A directory of test dlls (dlls/) which contains several "dummy" dlls each 
signed with varying degrees of validity (see cert_maker.bat for details)
-A directory of test certs (certificates/) which are not used directly in the
tests, but are useful for analyzing test failures.
-A script "cert_maker.bat" to generate these certs and sign the dlls.
