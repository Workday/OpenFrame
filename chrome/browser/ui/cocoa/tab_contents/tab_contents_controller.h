// A class that controls the WebContents view. It internally creates a container
// view (the NSView accessed by calling |-view|) which manages the layout and
// display of the WebContents view.
//
// Client code that inserts [controller view] into the view hierarchy needs to
// beforehand call the |-ensureContentsSizeDoesNotChange| method. This will
// avoid multiple resize messages being sent to the renderer and triggering
// redundant and costly layouts. After the view has been inserted, client code
// calls |-ensureContentsVisible| to display the WebContents view.
//
// AutoEmbedFullscreen mode: When enabled, TabContentsController will observe
// for WebContents fullscreen changes and automatically swap the normal
// WebContents view with the fullscreen view (if different). In addition, if a
// WebContents is being screen-captured, the view will be centered within the
// container view, sized to the aspect ratio of the capture video resolution,
// and scaling will be avoided whenever possible.
