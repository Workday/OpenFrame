// A class that knows how to draw an animated state to indicate progress.
// Creating the class starts the animation, destroying it stops it. There are
// two types:
//
// - Filmstrip: Draws via a sequence of frames in an image. There is no state
//   where the class is frozen on an image and not animating. The image needs to
//   be made of squares such that the height divides evenly into the width.
//
// - Toast: Draws an image animating down to the bottom and then another image
//   animating up from the bottom. Stops once the animation is complete.
