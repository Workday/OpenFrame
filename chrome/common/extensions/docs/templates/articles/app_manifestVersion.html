<h1>Manifest Version</h1>

<p>
  Applications are simply bundles of resources, wrapped
  up with a <a href="manifest.html"><code>manifest.json</code></a> file that
  describes the package's contents. The format of this file is generally stable,
  but occasionally breaking changes must be made to address important issues.
  Developers should specify which version of the manifest specification their
  package targets by setting a <code>manifest_version</code> key in their
  manifests.
</p>

<h2 id="current-version">Current Version</h2>

<p>
  Packaged app developers must currently specify
  <strong><code>'manifest_version': 2</code></strong>:
</p>

<pre>{
  ...,
  "manifest_version": 2,
  ...
}</pre>

<p>
  Manifest version 1 only applied to extensions and hosted apps, not
  packaged apps.  It
  was <a href="../extensions/manifestVersion.html">deprecated</a> in
  Chrome 18.
