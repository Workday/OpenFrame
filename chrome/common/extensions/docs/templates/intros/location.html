  To start retrieving location information, you need to create a location watch
  by calling $(ref:location.watchLocation), passing in
  the location watch details via the <code>requestInfo</code> parameter:
</p>

<pre>chrome.location.watchLocation(name, requestInfo);</pre>
<p>
  You also need to add a listener
  for the $(ref:location.onLocationUpdate) event.
  Chrome will fire this event after you create your location watch, and
  it will keep firing the event every time the geographic
  location of the host machine changes, until you call $(ref:location.clearWatch).
</p>
<p>
  Here's sample code
  to listen for location updates:
</p>
<pre>
  chrome.location.onLocationUpdate.addListener(function(position) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(position));
  });
</pre>
