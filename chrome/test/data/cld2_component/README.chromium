This directory contains a static copy of the contents of the CLD2 CRX file.
The ID of the extension (as well as other relevant information) can be found
in the following file:
  src/chrome/browser/component_updater/cld_component_installer.cc 

In general there should be little need to modify the data here. CLD2 updates
are rare and consist of incremental improvements to language detection
accuracy. All such updates are expected to be backwards-compatible from CLD2
revision 160 onwards, which was the initial version to be checked in. Any
future format-breaking changes are likely to result in a "CLD3".

For the sake of maintainability and clarity of purpose, the subdirectory that
contains the CRX extract is named for the version that is contained within it.
This mimics the behavior of the component updater and makes it obvious at a
glance which version of the CRX is checked in here; if you DO update the
content here, make sure to make a new directory and update the constant in the
test utilities class:
  src/chrome/browser/translate/translate_browser_test_utils.cc

If backwards compatibility is required, you'll have to add tests to try with
both the old version and the new.
