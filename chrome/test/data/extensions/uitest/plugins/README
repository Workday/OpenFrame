Note: plugin.dll is a Release build of npapi_layout_test_plugin with the mime
type changed, so it doesn't conflict with the original DLL.

On Linux plugin32.so and plugin64.so are Release builds of
npapi_layout_test_plugin with the mime type changed. The build machine is
running 64-bit Hardy with GCC 4.2.4. The binaries have been stripped with
strip --strip-unneeded.

On Mac, plugin.plugin is a Release build of TestNetscapePlugin.plugin with the
MIME type changed. This was built from the tree as of r192827, with manual
merging of the binaries:

(From both 32 and 64 bit checkouts:)
$ ninja -C out/Release TestNetscapePlugIn
(then)
$ lipo -create [...32...]/src/out/Release/TestNetscapePlugIn.plugin/Contents/MacOS/TestNetscapePlugIn \
    [...64...]src/out/Release/TestNetscapePlugIn.plugin/Contents/MacOS/TestNetscapePlugIn \
    -output [somewhere]/TestNetscapePlugIn
