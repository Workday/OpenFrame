// Instantiate with a chosen D-Bus object path, delegate, and other fields.
// The Bluetooth daemon communicates with a GATT characteristic using the
// standard DBus.Properties interface. While most properties of the GATT
// characteristic interface are read-only and don't change throughout the
// life-time of the object, the "Value" property is both writeable and its
// value can change. Both Get and Set operations performed on the "Value"
// property are delegated to the Delegate object, an instance of which is
// mandatory during initialization. In addition, a "SendValueChanged" method is
// provided, which emits a DBus.Properties.PropertyChanged signal for the
// "Value" property.
