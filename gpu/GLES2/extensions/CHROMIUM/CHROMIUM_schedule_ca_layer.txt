    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

Overview

    This extension allows a client to request a texture be presented as a
    CoreAnimation layer. The expectation is that all the CALayers scheduled
    since the last call to glSwapBuffers or glPostSubBufferCHROMIUM are
    displayed atomically at the time of the next call to swap buffers. Scheduled
    CALayers are not stateful and need to be rescheduled after the buffers were
    swapped.

    The command

        glScheduleCALayerCHROMIUM(GLuint contents_texture_id,
                                  const GLfloat* contents_rect,
                                  GLfloat opacity,
                                  GLuint background_color,
                                  const GLfloat* bounds_size,
                                  const GLfloat* transform);

    Set the CALayer parameters to be presented at the time of the next call to
    swap buffers. The order of the calls schedule CALayers determines their
    back-to-front presentation order.
    <contents_texture_id> is the texture to be presented. If zero, then the
    CALayer will be a solid color.
    <contents_rect> contains four values indicating the x, y, width, and height
    of the sub-rectangle to display from the texture specified in
    <contents_texture_id>, in normalized coordinates.
    <opacity> specifies the opacity of the CALayer.
    <background_color> specifies the background color of the CALayer, as a
    32-bit ARGB value.
    <bounds_size> contains two values indicating the width and height of the
    layer in pixels.
    <transform> contains sixteen values indicating the row major order 4x4
    transformation matrix to apply to the CALayer.
