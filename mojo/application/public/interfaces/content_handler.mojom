// Interface implemented by content handlers. To avoid race conditions with
// dropped requests, the implementation should keep a reference to the lifetime
// of the app (by holding on to AppRefCount). Each application started by
// StartApplication should call the callback given by that method on
// destruction. When the owner in the shell notices this, it will destroy the
// interface pointer, which should cause the strongly-bound ContentHandler
// implementation to self destruct and release the app reference.
