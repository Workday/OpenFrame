/**
 * Mount a new filesystem type.
 *
 * This function is declared in <sys/mount.h>, but we document it here
 * because nacl_io is controlled primarily through mount(2)/umount(2).
 *
 * Some parameters are dependent on the filesystem type being mounted.
 *
 * The |data| parameter, if used, is always parsed as a string of comma
 * separated key-value pairs:
 *   e.g. "key1=param1,key2=param2"
 *
 *
 * filesystem types:
 *   "memfs": An in-memory filesystem.
 *     source: Unused.
 *     data: Unused.
 *
 *   "dev": A filesystem with various utility nodes. Some examples:
 *          "null": equivalent to /dev/null.
 *          "zero": equivalent to /dev/zero.
 *          "urandom": equivalent to /dev/urandom.
 *          "console[0-3]": logs to the JavaScript console with varying log
 *              levels.
 *          "tty": Posts a message to JavaScript, which will send a "message"
 *              event from this module's embed element.
 *     source: Unused.
 *     data: Unused.
 *
 *   "html5fs": A filesystem that uses PPAPI FileSystem interface, which can be
 *              read in JavaScript via the HTML5 FileSystem API. This mount
 *              provides the use of persistent storage. Please read the
 *              documentation in ppapi/c/ppb_file_system.h for more information.
 *     source: Unused.
 *     data: A string of parameters:
 *       "type": Which type of filesystem to mount. Valid values are
 *           "PERSISTENT" and "TEMPORARY". The default is "PERSISTENT".
 *       "expected_size": The expected file-system size. Note that this does
 *           not request quota -- you must do that from JavaScript.
 *
 *   "httpfs": A filesystem that reads from a URL via HTTP.
 *     source: The root URL to read from. All paths read from this filesystem
 *             will be appended to this root.
 *             e.g. If source == "http://example.com/path", reading from
 *             "foo/bar.txt" will attempt to read from the URL
 *             "http://example.com/path/foo/bar.txt".
 *     data: A string of parameters:
 *       "allow_cross_origin_request": If "true", then reads from this
 *           filesystem will follow the CORS standard for cross-origin requests.
 *           See http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control.
 *       "allow_credentials": If "true", credentials are sent with cross-origin
 *           requests. If false, no credentials are sent with the request and
 *           cookies are ignored in the response.
 *       All other key/value pairs are assumed to be headers to use with
 *       HTTP requests.
 *
 *   "passthroughfs": A filesystem that passes all requests through to the
 *                    underlying NaCL calls. The primary use of this filesystem
 *                    is to allow reading NMF resources.
 *     source: Unused.
 *     data: Unused.
 *
 *
 * @param[in] source Depends on the filesystem type. See above.
 * @param[in] target The absolute path to mount the filesystem.
 * @param[in] filesystemtype The name of the filesystem type to mount. See
 *     above for examples.
 * @param[in] mountflags Unused.
 * @param[in] data Depends on the filesystem type. See above.
 * @return 0 on success, -1 on failure (with errno set).
 *
 * int mount(const char* source, const char* target, const char* filesystemtype,
 *         unsigned long mountflags, const void *data) NOTHROW;
