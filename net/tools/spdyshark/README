How to build SPDY dissector for Wireshark (Windows directions).

1) Retrieve wireshark source code.

> mkdir D:\src\wireshark
> cd D:\src\wireshark
> svn co http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/wireshark/trunk/ trunk

2) Retrieve the spdyshark source code.

> cd D:\src
> svn co http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/net/tools/spdyshark

3) Follow directions to build Wireshark from 

http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChSetupWin32.html

  - Read all the directions, there are a number of preliminary steps.

  - You may need to explicitly make C:\wireshark-win32-libs [or
    C:\wireshark-win64-libs]
 
  - Make sure PYTHON environment variable is set (this may not be the
  case if using the one from depot_tools). Although wireshark seems
  to require it, it tries to workaround missing PYTHON environment
  variables unsuccessfully. 

4) Make a symbolic link for spdyshark to Wireshark

> mklink /D D:\src\wireshark\trunk\plugins\spdyshark D:\src\spdyshark

5) Build the plugin.

> cd D:\src\wireshark\trunk\plugins\spdyshark
> nmake -f Makefile.nmake all

6) Move the plugin into the wireshark-gtk directory [should automate]

> copy D:\src\wireshark\trunk\plugins\spdyshark.dll
  D:\src\wireshark\trunk\wireshark-gtk2\plugins

7) Start wireshark, and confirm that SPDY plugin is loaded.

> D:\src\wireshark\trunk\wireshark-gtk2\wireshark.exe

Choose Edit > Preferences to bring up the Preferences dialog.

Exand "Protocols" in the left pane of the preferences dialog and
confirm that spdyshark is there.
