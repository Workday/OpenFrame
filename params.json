This add-on renders specific websites using the open-source [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home) browser which supports modern web technologies instead of the older IE rendering engine.\r\n\r\nAt Workday, we are committed to building cloud applications that go beyond the limits of traditional enterprise software. In order to achieve our goal of providing unparalleled levels of user experience within our applications, we make use of the new capabilities available only in modern browsers and this add-on allow for our customers who remain on older IE browser versions to experience all of the new Workday features and functionality.\r\n\r\nThis project is backed by [Workday](http://www.workday.com) and will be supported through August 2015.\r\n\r\n![Workday Open Frame](http://www.chromium.org/_/rsrc/1220197576998/Home/flying_browser.png)","google":"UA-42066322-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
