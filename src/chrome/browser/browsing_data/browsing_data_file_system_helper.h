// system data when a client calls StartFetching from the UI thread, and will
// notify the client via a supplied callback when the data is available.
// Only one StartFetching task can run at a time: executing StartFetching while
// another StartFetching task is running will DCHECK.

// The client's callback is passed a list of FileSystemInfo objects containing
// usage information for each origin's temporary and persistent file systems.
