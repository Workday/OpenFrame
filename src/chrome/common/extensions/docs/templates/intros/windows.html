<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>
<p>
To use the windows API,
you must declare the "tabs" permission
in <a href="manifest.html">manifest.json</a>.
(No, that isn't a typo &mdash;
the window and tabs modules interact so closely we
decided to just share one permission between them.)
For example:
</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  <b>"permissions": ["tabs"]</b>,
  ...
}</pre>

<h2 id="current-window">The current window</h2>

<p>Many functions in the extension system
take an optional <var>windowId</var> parameter,
which defaults to the current window.
</p>

<p>The <em>current window</em> is the window that
contains the code that is currently executing.
It's important to realize that this can be
different from the topmost or focused window.
</p>

<p>For example, say an extension
creates a few tabs or windows from a single HTML file,
and that the HTML file
contains a call to
$ref:tabs.query.
The current window is the window that contains the page that made
the call, no matter what the topmost window is.
</p>

<p>In the case of the <a href="event_pages.html">event page</a>,
the value of the current window falls back to the last active window. Under some
circumstances, there may be no current window for background pages.
</p>
