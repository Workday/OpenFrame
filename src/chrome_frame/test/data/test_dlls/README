This directory contains dummy DLLs intended to support testing of the module
scanning code currently in Chrome Frame (in module_utils.cc at time of writing).

The DLLs contain no code of mention and export a DllGetClassObject function.
The only main difference between them is that they have different version
numbers in the FileVersion and ProductVersion fields of their
VS_VERSION_INFO resources.
