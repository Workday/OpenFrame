Release: between 3.0 and 3.1
Security Critical: no

Description:
Mongoose is an easy to use web server. It can be embedded into existing
application to provide a web interface to it.

Only the necessary core server is checked in and not the test nor the
bindings to multiple languages.  The server is only used to serve custom
URLs from the JSON over HTTP webdriver protocol.

Note:  There is no make file for this project, it's compiled directly in
the chrome version of webdriver found under the directory:
  src/chrome/test/webdriver

Local modifications (all detailed in chrome-mongoose-modifications.diff,
pending upstreaming by danielwh):
* Fixed a couple of Windows/VS2010 compiler warnings/errors
* Fixed linger code to apply to sockets from bind, rather than shutdown
* Don't ignore SIGCHLD, since the proxy launcher depends on it for determining
  chrome's exit code.
* Removed a "set but never used" variable, to fix build for gcc 4.6.
* Fixed a compiler warning (-Wmaybe-uninitialized).
