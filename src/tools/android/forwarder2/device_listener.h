// A DeviceListener instance is used in the device_forwarder program to bind to
// a specific device-side |port| and wait for client connections. When a
// connection happens, it informs the corresponding HostController instance
// running on the host, through |host_socket|. Then the class expects a call to
// its SetAdbDataSocket() method (performed by the device controller) once the
// host opened a new connection to the device. When this happens, a new internal
// Forwarder instance is started.
// Note that instances of this class are owned by the device controller which
// creates and destroys them on the same thread. In case an internal error
// happens on the DeviceListener's internal thread, the DeviceListener
// can also self-delete by executing the user-provided callback on the thread
// the DeviceListener was created on.
// Note that the DeviceListener's destructor joins its internal thread (i.e.
// waits for its completion) which means that the internal thread is guaranteed
// not to be running anymore once the object is deleted.
