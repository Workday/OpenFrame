Page Cycler Tests with Web Page Replay
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web Page Replay is a proxy that can record and "play" web pages with
simulated network characteristics -- without having to edit the pages
by hand. With WPR, tests can use "real" web content, and catch
performance issues that may result from introducing network delays and
bandwidth throttling.

The Chromium extension here is used to load URLs, record the times,
and set the appropriate cookies for src/tools/page_cycler/common/report.html.
