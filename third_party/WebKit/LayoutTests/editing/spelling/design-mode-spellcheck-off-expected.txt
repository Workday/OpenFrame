This tests whether WebKit does not spell check in 'designMode' when spellcheck='false'. To test manually, click 'asd' and move cursor until '.'. There should be no spelling marker for 'asd'.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

document.body.setAttribute("spellcheck", "true")
PASS internals.hasSpellingMarker(document, 0, 3) became different from false
