Test if WebKit removes grammar markers when we edit a grammatically-incorrect word. To test manually, type a grammatically-incorrect sentence "You has the right." and type a backspace key to delete the last character of "has". This test succeeds when "ha" does not have grammar markers.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
