Misspelling markers in text inputs should only be visible if an input is being edited but removing markers from the input must not touch other markers. To test manually, focus the text input, then focus the second text area. The test succeed if misspellings were removed from the input but not for the first textarea. Focus the input again - misspelling markers should be restored.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
