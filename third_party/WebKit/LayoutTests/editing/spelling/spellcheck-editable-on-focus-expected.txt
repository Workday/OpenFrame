PASS internals.markerCountForNode(findFirstTextNode(testTextArea), "spelling") became expectedNumberOfMarkers
PASS internals.markerCountForNode(findFirstTextNode(testTextField), "spelling") became expectedNumberOfMarkers
PASS internals.markerCountForNode(findFirstTextNode(testEditable), "spelling") became expectedNumberOfMarkers
