Spelling should work for double-clicked misspellings. To test manually, type 'wellcome home.', double-click on 'wellcome', and context-click on the selection. The test succeeds when the context menu shows spell check suggestions.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
