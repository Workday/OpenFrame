Spelling should work when the user selects a multi-word misspelling exactly. To test manually, enable 'Ask Google for Suggestions' in Chrome, type 'It should be upper case.', select 'upper case', and context-click on the selection.The test succeeds when the context menu shows spelling suggestions.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
