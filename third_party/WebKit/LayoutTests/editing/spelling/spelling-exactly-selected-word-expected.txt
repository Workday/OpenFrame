Spelling should work when the user selects the misspelled word exactly. To test manually, type 'wellcome home.', select 'wellcome', and context-click on the selection. The test succeeds when the context menu shows spelling suggestions.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
