Text to check is divided into chunks to make sure checking some huge text does not freeze the page/UI. With the synchronous spell checker only one chunk is checked. To test manaully trigger spell checking of the editable (e.g. by copy+paste) with unified and synchronous checker on. Only 3 first misspellings should be marked.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
