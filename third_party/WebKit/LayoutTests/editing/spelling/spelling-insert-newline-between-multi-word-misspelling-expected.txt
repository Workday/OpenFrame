Spelling should work when the user inserts a newline between a multi word misspelling. To test manually, enable 'Ask Google for Suggestions' in Chrome, type 'It should be upper case.'.The test succeeds if there are no spelling markers under 'upper case'.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS spellingMarkerRange.toString() is "upper case"
PASS firstMarkerRange is null
PASS secondMarkerRange is null
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
It should be upperÂ 
case.
