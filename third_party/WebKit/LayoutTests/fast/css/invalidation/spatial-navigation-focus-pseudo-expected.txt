Use descendant invalidation set in the presence of an :-internal-spatial-navigation-focus pseudo class.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


This test relies on the bug (crbug.com/432436) that internal pseudo classes are being
exposed to the extent that they are not dropped, but in the case of :-internal-spatial-navigation-focus,
never matched. If the mentioned bug is fixed this test will start failing. When that happens,
we need to either add the possibility to use internal css features in author style for tests,
support injecting UA style for tests, or drop this test.

PASS getComputedStyle(b).backgroundColor is transparent
PASS internals.updateStyleAndReturnAffectedElementCount() is 1
PASS getComputedStyle(b).backgroundColor is green
