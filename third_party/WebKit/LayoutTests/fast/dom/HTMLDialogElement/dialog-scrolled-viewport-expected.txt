This tests that a modal dialog's containing block is the initial containing block.
The dialog should be onscreen with a width of 50% of the viewport. It is the child of a narrow element positioned off screen, but its containing block is the initial containing block, so its position and percent lengths are relative to that.
PASS dialog.offsetParent is null
PASS dialog.offsetTop is 1200
PASS dialog.offsetLeft is 1200
PASS dialog.clientWidth is expectedWidth
PASS successfullyParsed is true
