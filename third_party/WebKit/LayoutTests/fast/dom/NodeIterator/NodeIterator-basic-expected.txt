PASS Construct a NodeIterator by document.createNodeIterator(root). 
PASS Construct a NodeIterator by document.createNodeIterator(root, undefined, undefined). 
PASS Give an invalid root node to document.createNodeIterator(). 
PASS Iterate over all nodes forward then backward. 
PASS Iterate over all elements forward then backward. 
PASS Iterate over all text nodes forward then backward. 
PASS Iterate over all comment nodes forward then backward. 
PASS Test the behavior of NodeIterator when no nodes match with the given filter. 
PASS Test the behavior of NodeIterator when NodeFilter is specified. 
PASS Optional arguments to createNodeIterator should be optional (3 passed, null). 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
