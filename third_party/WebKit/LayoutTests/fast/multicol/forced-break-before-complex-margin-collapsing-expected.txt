Given a parent block with a forced break before, and with an empty collapse-through child followed by a child with a top margin, check that the parent block still ends up at the exact top of the next column. The collapse-through child prevents us from correctly estimating the logical top of the parent initially.

Below there should be a yellow box. Inside it there should be a bottom-left aligned blue box and a top-center aligned green box.
