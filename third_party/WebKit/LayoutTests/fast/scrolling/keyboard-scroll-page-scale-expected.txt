Test that keyboard scrolling while the page is scaled scrolls both viewports. To test manually, pinch zoom into the page and use the arrow keys, page up/down, home/end to scroll the page. You should be able to reach the end of the page bounds (i.e. scroll to see the divs at the bounds.)

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
Testing arrow keys:
PASS internals.visualViewportScrollY() is > 0
