This tests starting a new resource load after the load event has finished, then reloading while that load is still in progress. Due to a regression in http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?revision=148684&view=revision, we would overwrite the load type such that the reload will still be executed correctly, but the history entry will be created as though it was a standard load.
