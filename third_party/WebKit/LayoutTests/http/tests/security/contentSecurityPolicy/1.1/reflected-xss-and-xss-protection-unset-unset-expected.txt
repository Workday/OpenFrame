CONSOLE ERROR: line 4: The XSS Auditor refused to execute a script in 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(0x58,0x53,0x53))%3C/script%3E' because its source code was found within the request. The auditor was enabled as the server sent neither an 'X-XSS-Protection' nor 'Content-Security-Policy' header.
