CONSOLE ERROR: Script from origin 'http://localhost:8000' has been blocked from loading by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access.
This test passes if the inserted script fails to load due to CORS.

PASS (expected error reported)
