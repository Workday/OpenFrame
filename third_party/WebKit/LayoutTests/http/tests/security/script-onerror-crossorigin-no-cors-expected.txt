CONSOLE ERROR: Script from origin 'http://localhost:8000' has been blocked from loading by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access.
The test passes if 'window.onerror' is not invoked on a script loaded with a 'crossorigin' attribute, but delivered without valid CORS headers.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
