CONSOLE ERROR: line 4: The XSS Auditor refused to execute a script in 'http://localhost:8000/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl?q=%3Csvg%3E%3Cscript%3E%3Ciframe%20onload=alert(0)%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3C/script%3E%3C/svg%3E' because its source code was found within the request. The auditor was enabled as the server sent neither an 'X-XSS-Protection' nor 'Content-Security-Policy' header.
 Test that dangerous attributes are still filtered in netsted script contexts.
