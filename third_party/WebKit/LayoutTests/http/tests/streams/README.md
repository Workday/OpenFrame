# Streams Tests in Blink

These tests are drawn from those [in the reference implementation](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/tree/master/reference-implementation)'s web-platform-tests subdirectory. Eventually they will be upstreamed to web-platform-tests proper.

Slight modifications have been made in some cases, e.g. to remove references to `pipeTo` and `pipeThrough` since we have not implemented those yet.
