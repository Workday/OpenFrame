This directory contains files imported from the W3C.

== THIS DIRECTORY IS OBSOLETE ==

Tests are now imported into LayoutTests/imported (see README there).

The tests in LayoutTests/http/tests/w3c/webperf were imported from
https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/ but have been migrated into the
https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests repo:

* HighResolutionTime -> hr-time/
* navigation-timing -> navigation-timing/
* resource-timing -> resource-timing/
* UserTiming -> user-timing/

This directory now contains:

* Submissions that were not "approved" - these should be reviewed
  for redundancy with approved tests in web-platform-tests

* Tests that require a http/s server. Tracked as:
  http://crbug.com/360762

Please do not add additional tests to this directory, and strive
to remove them. Removing this directory is tracked as:
http://crbug.com/498037

== Previous Documentation ==

With only one exception (below), these files should not be modified directly. Instead, please
source the files from the following locations:

resources/testharness.js - and...
resources/testharness.css - Fetch from http://w3c-test.org/resources/

resources/testharnessreport.js - Modify directly. It's the vendor specific portion.

webperf/ - Use Tools/Scripts/import-w3c-performance-wg-tests
