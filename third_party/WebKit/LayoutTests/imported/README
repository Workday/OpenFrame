The test suites in this directory are imported from third parties.

In particular the tests in web-platform-tests and csswg-test are imported
from the W3C's test suite repositories on GitHub.

Use Tools/Scripts/update-w3c-deps to update the tests from the tip of tree
in those repositories.

Any modifications made directly to the tests in these directories will be
overwritten on the next import, so, don't modify the tests :).

It is safe and okay to check in generic baselines for any tests that fail.
The baselines will not be overwritten.

For more information on this process and Blink's handling of the W3C's
test suites, see http://www.chromium.org/blink/importing-the-w3c-tests .
