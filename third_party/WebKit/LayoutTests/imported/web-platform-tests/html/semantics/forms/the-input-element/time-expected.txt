This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS time element of default time value 
PASS step attribute on default value check 
PASS max  attribute on default value check 
PASS min  attribute on default value check 
PASS type attribute support on input element 
PASS max attribute support on input element 
PASS min attribute support on input element 
PASS step attribute support on input element 
PASS stepUp function support on input Element 
PASS stepDown function support on input Element 
PASS stepUp step value empty on default step value  
PASS stepDown step value empty default step value 
PASS stepUp on step value minus 
PASS stepDown on step value minus 
PASS stepUp on step value zero  
PASS stepDown on step value zero  
PASS stepUp on step value 24 hour 
PASS stepDown on step value 24 hour  
PASS stepUp on step value hour   
PASS stepDown on step value hour  
PASS stepUp on step value second  
PASS stepDown on step value second  
PASS stepUp on step value miri second  
PASS stepDown on step value miri second  
PASS stepUp argment 2 times 
PASS stepDown argment 2 times 
FAIL stepUp stop because it exceeds the maximum value assert_equals: expected "15:00" but got "15:00:00"
FAIL stepDown Stop so lower than the minimum value assert_equals: expected "13:00" but got "13:00:00"
FAIL stop at border on stepUp assert_equals: expected "15:01" but got "15:00"
PASS stop at border on stepDown 
PASS  empty value of stepUp 
PASS set value on not time format value 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
