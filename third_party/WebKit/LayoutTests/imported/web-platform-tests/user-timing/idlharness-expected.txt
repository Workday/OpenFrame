This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Performance interface: operation mark(DOMString) 
PASS Performance interface: operation clearMarks(DOMString) 
PASS Performance interface: operation measure(DOMString,DOMString,DOMString) 
PASS Performance interface: operation clearMeasures(DOMString) 
PASS Performance must be primary interface of window.performance 
PASS Stringification of window.performance 
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "mark" with the proper type (0) 
PASS Performance interface: calling mark(DOMString) on window.performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "clearMarks" with the proper type (1) 
PASS Performance interface: calling clearMarks(DOMString) on window.performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "measure" with the proper type (2) 
PASS Performance interface: calling measure(DOMString,DOMString,DOMString) on window.performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "clearMeasures" with the proper type (3) 
PASS Performance interface: calling clearMeasures(DOMString) on window.performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS PerformanceMark interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS PerformanceMark interface object length 
FAIL PerformanceMark interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of PerformanceMark.prototype expected "[object PerformanceMarkPrototype]" but got "[object Object]"
PASS PerformanceMark interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS PerformanceMeasure interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS PerformanceMeasure interface object length 
FAIL PerformanceMeasure interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of PerformanceMeasure.prototype expected "[object PerformanceMeasurePrototype]" but got "[object Object]"
PASS PerformanceMeasure interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
