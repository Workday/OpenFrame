Tests the Timeline window filter.

It applies different ranges to the OverviewGrid and expects that current view reflects the change.

Also it detects that after switching to another view it gets the proper time range.

OverviewPane:
divider offsets: [0, 500, 1000, 1500]. We are expecting round numbers.

range = 0 - 1
time range = 1122673092.068 - 1122674564.291
records count: 107
divider offsets: [0, 500, 1000, 1500]. We are expecting round numbers.

range = 0.25 - 0.75
time range = 1122673460.12375 - 1122674196.23525
records count: 48
divider offsets: [400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200]. We are expecting round numbers.
