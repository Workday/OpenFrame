Test looping edge case to verify http://crbug.com/364442. Steps:

Seek toward end of video (for faster testing).
Play video to end with 'loop' set to false.
Once ended, set 'loop' to true.
Call play.
Verify that 'seeked' event fires, seeking back to the beginning.
Pause video and end test.

++ Video is initially paused and 'loop' unset.
EXPECTED (video.paused == 'true') OK
EXPECTED (video.loop == 'false') OK

++ Seek to just before the end of the video and play.
RUN(video.currentTime = video.duration - .5)
RUN(video.play())

EVENT(play)
EVENT(ended)

++ Verify played to end and stopped.
EXPECTED (video.ended == 'true') OK
EXPECTED (video.paused == 'true') OK
EXPECTED (video.currentTime == 'video.duration') OK

++ With playback ended, set 'loop' attribute. This will cause ended == false; looping video cannot be 'ended', only paused.
EXPECTED (video.loop == 'false') OK
RUN(video.loop = true)
EXPECTED (video.loop == 'true') OK
EXPECTED (video.ended == 'false') OK
EXPECTED (video.paused == 'true') OK

++ Play video with 'loop' set. Expect seek back to start.
RUN(video.play())

EVENT(play)
EVENT(seeked)

++ Observed seek. Verify current time decreased and still playing.
EXPECTED (video.loop == 'true') OK
EXPECTED (video.paused == 'false') OK
EXPECTED (video.ended == 'false') OK
EXPECTED (video.currentTime < 'video.duration') OK

++ Pausing now that test is over to prevent additional unwanted looping.
RUN(video.pause())

END OF TEST
