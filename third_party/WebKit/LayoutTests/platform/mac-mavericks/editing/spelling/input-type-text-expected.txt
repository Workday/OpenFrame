Spell check selects the misspelled word on context click in an input field. To test manually, type 'wellcome home.' and context-click on 'wellcome'. The test succeeds when 'wellcome' is selected after the context click.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
