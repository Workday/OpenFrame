Test Different PeriodicWave Lengths at Different Sample Rates

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS At 192 kHz, PeriodicWave with 8192 coefficients vs 2048: differ as expected.
PASS At 192 kHz, PeriodicWave with 2049 coefficients vs 2048: differ as expected.
