Test PeriodicWave Normalization

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS amplitude is 1 within a relative error of 0.00001.
PASS null: amplitude is 1 within a relative error of 0.00001.
PASS {"disableNormalization":false}: amplitude is 1 within a relative error of 0.00001.
PASS {"disableNormalization":true}: amplitude is 10 within a relative error of 0.00001.
PASS {"disableNormalization":"foo"}: amplitude is 10 within a relative error of 0.00001.
PASS {"disableNormalization":null}: amplitude is 1 within a relative error of 0.00001.
PASS {"randomKey":true}: amplitude is 1 within a relative error of 0.00001.
PASS {"key1":"value1","key2":42}: amplitude is 1 within a relative error of 0.00001.
PASS {"key1":"value1","disableNormalization":true}: amplitude is 10 within a relative error of 0.00001.
PASS {"key1":"value1","disableNormalization":false}: amplitude is 1 within a relative error of 0.00001.
PASS [1,2,3]: amplitude is 1 within a relative error of 0.00001.
