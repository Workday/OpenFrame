Local changes:
* ImageAndTextCell.h: Changed 'image' property to 'retain' mode to fix a crash.
* ImageAndTextCell.m: Moved '@synthesize' to to the top of '@implementation' as
                      suggested by a clang warning.
* ImageAndTextCell.m: Switched from -[NSImage compositeToPoint:operation:] to
                      -[NSImage drawInRect:fromRect:operation:fraction:respectFlipped:hints:]
                      as the former is deprecated and doesn't work properly in
                      HiDPI.
