// |ConnectionManager| is an interface for the system that allows "connections"
// (i.e., native "pipes") to be established between different processes.
//
// The starting point for establishing such a connection is that the two
// processes (not necessarily distinct) are provided with a common
// |ConnectionIdentifier|, and also some (probably indirect, temporary) way of
// communicating.
//
// (The usual case for this are processes A, B, C, with connections A <-> B <->
// C, with the goal being to establish a direct connection A <-> C. Process B
// generates a |ConnectionIdentifier| that it transmits to A and C, and serves
// as an intermediary until A and C are directly connected.)
//
// To establish such a connection, each process calls |AllowConnect()| with the
// common |ConnectionIdentifier|. Each process then informs the other process
// that it has done so. Once a process knows that both processes have called
// |AllowConnect()|, it proceeds to call |Connect()|.
//
// On success, if the two processes are in fact distinct, |Connect()| provides a
// native (platform) handle for a "pipe" that connects/will connect the two
// processes. (If they are in fact the same process, success will simply yield
// no valid handle, to indicate this case.)
//
// Additionally, on success |Connect()| also provides a unique identifier for
// the peer process. In this way, processes may recognize when they already have
// a direct connection and reuse that, disposing of the new one provided by
// |Connect()|. (TODO(vtl): This is somewhat wasteful, but removes the need to
// handle various race conditions, and for the "master" process -- see below --
// to track connection teardowns.)
//
// Implementation notes: We implement this using a "star topology", with a
// single trusted "master" (broker) process and an arbitrary number of untrusted
// "slave" (client) processes. The former is implemented by
// |MasterConnectionManager| (master_connection_manager.*) and the latter by
// |SlaveConnectionManager| (slave_connection_manager.*). Each slave is
// connected to the master by a special dedicated |RawChannel|, on which it does
// synchronous IPC (note, however, that the master should never block on any
// slave).
