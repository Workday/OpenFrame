Instructions below are for building standalone OTS utilities, if you want to
use OTS as a library then the recommended way is to copy the source code and
integrate it into your existing build system. Our build system does not build
a shared library intentionally.

General build instructions:

  1. If you are building from cloned Git repository, you will need to update
     the git sub modules, as well as run autoreconf. A convenience script is
     provided:

     $ ./autogen.sh

  2. Build OTS

     $ ./configure
     $ make

  3. Run the tests (if you wish)

     $ make check

Building on Windows:

   1. A POSIX-compatible environment is required to build OTS, MSYS2 is
      recommended. Follow the installation instructions on
	  https://msys2.github.io/.

   2. Install the required packages:

      $ pacman -S autoconf automake pkg-config gcc make zlib-devel

   3. Follow the general build instructions above.
