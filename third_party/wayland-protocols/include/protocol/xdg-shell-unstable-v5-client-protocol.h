/**
 * xdg_popup - short-lived, popup surfaces for menus
 * @popup_done: popup interaction is done
 *
 * A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface that can be used
 * to implement menus. It takes an explicit grab on the surface that will
 * be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup. This can be done by the
 * user clicking outside the surface, using the keyboard, or even locking
 * the screen through closing the lid or a timeout.
 *
 * When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out, and at
 * the same time the surface will be unmapped. The xdg_popup object is now
 * inert and cannot be reactivated, so clients should destroy it.
 * Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also dismiss the popup
 * and unmap the surface.
 *
 * Clients will receive events for all their surfaces during this grab
 * (which is an "owner-events" grab in X11 parlance). This is done so that
 * users can navigate through submenus and other "nested" popup windows
 * without having to dismiss the topmost popup.
 *
 * Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another surface of their own
 * is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy request.
 *
 * The parent surface must have either an xdg_surface or xdg_popup role.
 *
 * Specifying an xdg_popup for the parent means that the popups are nested,
 * with this popup now being the topmost popup. Nested popups must be
 * destroyed in the reverse order they were created in, e.g. the only popup
 * you are allowed to destroy at all times is the topmost one.
 *
 * If there is an existing popup when creating a new popup, the parent must
 * be the current topmost popup.
 *
 * A parent surface must be mapped before the new popup is mapped.
 *
 * When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they will likely dismiss
 * every nested popup as well. When a compositor dismisses popups, it will
 * follow the same dismissing order as required from the client.
 *
 * The x and y arguments passed when creating the popup object specify
 * where the top left of the popup should be placed, relative to the local
 * surface coordinates of the parent surface. See xdg_shell.get_xdg_popup.
 *
 * The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
 * for the xdg_popup state to take effect.
 *
 * For a surface to be mapped by the compositor the client must have
 * committed both the xdg_popup state and a buffer.
