See http://dev.chromium.org/developers/tree-sheriffs/perf-sheriffs#TOC-Selecting-an-acceptable-range-of-results
for a general explanation of how performance expectations work.

Instead of the regular make_expectations.py call, run this:

../perf_expectations/make_expectations.py -c webrtc_perf_expectations.cfg

We keep the WebRTC perf expectations aside since the tests are running on an
internal master for now.
